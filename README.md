# CaptionBoard

Abstract. CaptionBoard is an app that can be used to outsource captions for a storyboard. The storyboard is simple, it is
composed of up to 10 photos, and each photo needs an eye-catching caption. The photos have carefully been selected and
sequenced to mimic some story, ad, goal, etc. In the end, the client is going to use a video maker to make a video out of all
the photos, add the captions that he/she likes, where every photo is displayed for around 3 seconds. Think of the client as an
advertisement / marketing company that tries to find the best captions/text that speak to the customer base, or any other
company that uses the 30s video for some outreach purpose.
Workers: Basically, the app should be sent to a few free-lancers (or the public) that are interested in captioning those photos.
Selection: It is the Admin, or some other members of my company, to decide which captions we will end up using, hence, the
App should also work in the View-Mode, such that the admin can have a look at the captions, pick the ones that really work
for him/her.
Language modality: Formal, slang, funny, etc.
Timing: The 3 second duration to present each photo is not mandatory, the duration can be decreased or increased depending
on the scene content, captions the Worker wants to input. Any limits on duration? I would say 2s to 7s, but this means the
Worker can control the duration. Or, it can be the Admin who sets this duration value as Fixed and Prohibits the Workers from
playing with it. By the end of the day, the 10 photos and their captions should sum up to a 30 seconds duration (video).
